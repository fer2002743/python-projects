**ROULLETE**

This is my first python project, its functioning is very straightforward you have to choose a ramdon number between 1 and 49 and an amount to bet. If you guess the correct number  you gain earn 50 times your bet. However, if you do not guess the correct number you loose.

In this simple project I practised:
- Input validation
- If statements
- While loops
- Funcitons

I also tried to apply some good practices such as avoiding code repetition by using functions and writing everything in the main function of the program.

I know this is a very simple project but I have applied all my knowledge here and I hope to improve my skills.
